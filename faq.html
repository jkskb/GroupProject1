            <p></p>
            Living in an area of the country that has experienced a number of hurricanes, we are aware of the need for immediate information building up to, during and immediately following a storm. In these times, the usual sources for shop hours become unreliable. Additionally, this is not a time when you can count on water, gas or food to be in stock.  We also find that during and immediately following a storm that there is a desire to get out of the house, even if it's just to wander around the grocery store. While you want to get our, leaving your home and just wandering isn't safe nor practicle.</div>
